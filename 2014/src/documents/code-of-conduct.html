<h2 class="section-title">We Stand for a Welcoming Community</h2>

<p>At our conferences we encourage respectful smart conversations that help improvement and inspire innovation. Sexism, racism, and being an asshole in general is not appreciated. If you do so, get prepared to be challenged by conference staff, who will probably ask what's wrong with you.</p>
